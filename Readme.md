# Ancient machines

## About
Ancient Machines is my first rimworld mod. It's mostly a learning experience for me but hopefully will add some nice non-intrusive additions to the game. If you test it, please tell me of any bugs!

## Current State
Currently it's in v0.1.95. It's playable and shouldn't generate any errors but it doesn't add a massive amount at this time.


### Special Thanks
 Learning to make rimworld mods has been so much easier thanks to some awesome members of the community!

Extra special thanks to Kitty14 who taught me just about everything I know about rimworld and made it a thousand times more fun for me. I hope one day you will finally find out what the f*ck barbara is doing.
